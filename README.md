#DESCRIPTION: I have built a fully functional interactive quiz application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates a well-organized structure that covers various functionalities, including displaying questions, selecting answers, moving to the next question, and presenting the final score.
User Flow:
1) The quiz starts by displaying the first question and its corresponding answers.
2) The user selects an answer, which is then visually marked as correct or incorrect.
3) After selecting an answer, the "Next Question" button becomes active, allowing the user to proceed.
4) On the final question, the "Submit" button is shown instead of the "Next Question" button.
5) Once the quiz is completed, the user's score is displayed.

Features and Functionality:
1)Questions and answers are dynamically generated from the questions array.
2)Correct and incorrect answers are visually distinguished using color changes.
3)The score is incremented for each correct answer and displayed at the end.
