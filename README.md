#DESCRIPTION: I have built a fully functional interactive E-LEARNING PLATFORM UI created using HTML AND CSS.This platform allows users to access online courses and track their progress in an organized and visually appealing manner.
1. HTML Structure:
   The HTML document follows a structured approach using semantic elements to enhance readability and maintainability:

  a. Header
      The <header> section at the top of the document contains the title "E-Learning Platform." Styled with a bold background color (#0646ae) and white text, it creates a          visually striking introduction to the website.

  b. Navigation Bar
      The <nav> element provides links to key sections of the platform: "Courses" and "Progress." It uses a flexible layout, centering the links horizontally. Each link is         styled to stand out with white text and hover effects that underline the text for a more interactive user experience.

  c. Main Content
      The <main> section is the core of the platform and is divided into two key sections:
          A) Courses Section:
                This section is represented by the <section> tag with the ID courses.
                The courses are displayed in a grid layout, making use of the CSS Grid property. Each course occupies a responsive card that adjusts its size based on the                    screen width, ensuring a user-friendly experience across devices.
                Each course card consists of:
                A course title (<h3>).
                An embedded YouTube video (<iframe>), allowing users to preview or learn from the content directly on the platform.
          B)Progress Tracking Section:
                The progress tracking section is defined by the <section> tag with the ID progress.
                It features a list of progress bars for the courses offered. Each course is displayed with its title and a horizontal progress bar, visually representing the                 user's completion percentage.
  d. Footer
      The <footer> section provides a copyright statement. It is styled with the same background color as the header, ensuring design consistency, and features centered text       for simplicity.

2. CSS Styling
The inline <style> tag defines the CSS rules used to style the platform. The design emphasizes responsiveness, simplicity, and user-friendliness.

3. Features and Benefits
   A)Responsiveness:
         The site remains functional and visually appealing across different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
   B)Progress Tracking:
         Visual indicators for course completion percentages provide users with immediate feedback on their learning progress.
